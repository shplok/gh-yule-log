A [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) extension that turns your terminal into a festive, animated Yule log :fire:

Vibe-coded with GitHub Copilot Agent and GPT-5.1 the week before Christmas 2025.

## Requirements

- `gh` (GitHub CLI) installed and configured
- A modern terminal that supports ANSI colors

gh extension install leereilly/gh-yule-log
```

For local development:

## Inspiration

I was surfing Netflix the other night and was astonished at how many [branded Yule logs there were](https://youtu.be/ytMdeo9Re1k?si=Fowy4F-40MmdwMcp). I figured GitHub should get in on that action! Also inspired by [@msimpson's crses-based ASCII art fire art from back in the day](https://gist.github.com/msimpson/1096950).
